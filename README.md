## Project: Deploy a web app game reviews

This project is to practice on deployment. We got the data from customer in json format. We need to tranfer the data into Sql, and using some analytical methods for data visualization, then using Heroku for as a deployed method. The user interface should deliver the insights, overviews about how games got reviews. 

### Requirement:
  + Use Streamlit or Heroku to deloy your app
  + Demonstrate some visualizations (plots) the data
### Installation
  + This app was deployed by Heroku server using Flash, so we just go directly to the website
